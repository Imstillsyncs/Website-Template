# Website Template
This website template is for you to use. This is for Youtuber's that codes and makes websites, games, and etc.
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Imstillsyncs/Website-Template)](https://repl.it/github/Imstillsyncs/Website-Template)
If you would like to change the style of the website, use the ``style.css`` file.
For the projects page, if you don't want the "New" Badge right beside the project, remove this line `<span class="badge">New</span>`
For pictures, add it to the `/images` directory.
You have a search page so users can navigate to pages.
If you don't want the requests page, you can remove it, if you're going to use it I would recommend you use [Cognito Forms](https://www.cognitoforms.com/).
